                                <h2>What is Vedic Maths?</h2>
                                <p>Vedic maths is a system of mathematics that was rediscovered by Swami Bharati Krishna Tirthaji in the
                                    early 20th
                                    century.</p>
                                <p>He claimed that he found 16 sutras (formulas) and 13 sub-sutras (sub-formulas) in the Vedas that can be
                                    used to solve
                                    any mathematical problem.</p>
                                <p>Vedic maths is not only about arithmetic, but also covers algebra, geometry, trigonometry, calculus, and
                                    more. Vedic
                                    maths is based on the principle of unity, which means that everything is connected and can be simplified
                                    to a single
                                    entity.</p>

                    <h2>History of Vedic Maths</h2>
                    <p>The Vedas, which date back more than 5,000 years, are the most honored and ancient texts in Hinduism. The
                        word “Veda” in
                        Sanskrit means “knowledge” or “wisdom.” The Rigveda, Yajurveda, Samaveda and Atharvaveda are the four
                        divisions of the
                        Vedas. The Brahmana (rituals),the Samhita (hymns), the Upanishad (philosophy) and the Aranyaka (forest
                        literature) make
                        up each of the four sections.</p>
                
                    <p>The Sulba Sutras, which are part of the Kalpa Sutras (ritual manuals), contain the majority of the Vedic
                        mathematical knowledge. The Sulba Sutras are concerned with the building of altars and geometric shapes for sacrifice
                        rites. They also include early instances of algebraic equations, the Pythagorean theorem, irrational numbers, square
                        roots, and pi.</p>
                
                    <p>Vedic Mathematics was rediscovered by Indian mathematician <strong>Jagadguru Shri Bharati Krishna Tirthaji</strong> between
                        1911 and 1918. He was a Sanskrit, math, history, and philosophy expert. From 1925 until 1960, he was also the
                        Shankaracharya
                        (spiritual head) of Puri. He spent several years researching the Vedas and other ancient manuscripts,
                        claiming to have
                        discovered a cohesive mathematical system concealed within them.</p>
                
                    <p>These formulae were later published in a book called Vedic Mathematics in 1965. The system is based on 16
                        sutras (formulae) and 13 sub sutras.</p>

                <h2>Interesting Facts & Formulae :</h2>

                <h3>Vertically and Crosswise Multiplication (Urdhva Tiryagbhyam) :</h3>
                <p>This technique allows for rapid multiplication of numbers. It's particularly useful when multiplying numbers with
                multiple digits.</p>
                <p>Formula: Let's say you want to multiply two numbers, ab and cd.</p>
                <p>The product is given by: (10a+b) x (10c+d)</p>
                <p>To find the product:
                Multiply the digits in the vertical and crosswise direction.
                Add the results to get the final product.</p>

                <h3>Squaring Numbers Ending in 5 (Ekadhikena Purvena):</h3>
                <p>Squaring numbers ending in 5 becomes extremely simple with this technique.</p>
                <p>Formula: To square a number ending in 5, let's say N5 follow these steps:
                Multiply the digit before 5 by itself plus 1 to get the first part of the result.
                Append 25 to the result.</p>
                <p>Example: To square 35, 3 x (3+1) gives 12, and appending 25 gives 1225.</p>

                <h3>Digital Roots and Casting Out Nines:</h3>
                <p>Vedic maths includes techniques for quickly checking the accuracy of calculations through digital roots.</p>
                <p>Digital Root: The digital root of a number is the sum of its digits, and if the result is a two-digit number, its digits
                are summed again.</p>
                <p>Casting Out Nines: This is a method for checking the correctness of arithmetic operations. The idea is that if the sum
                of the digits of the result is the same as the sum of the digits of the operands, then the operation is likely correct.</p>
                <p>Example: If you add 123 and 456, the sum is 579. The digital root of 123 is 6, the digital root of 456 is 6, and the
                digital root of 579 is 3. Since 6 + 6 ≠ 3, an error may be present in the calculation.</p>

                    <p>Vedic maths tricks are also known as sub-sutras or corollaries. They are derived from the main sutras and provide
                    additional methods or shortcuts to solve problems faster and easier. There are 13 sub sutras. These sub sutras are
                    discussed below in the table.</p>
